## Project Report

The most challenging part of this project was figuring out how to do the spawning and respawning for the enemies. I came up with a sort of arrary of Area2Ds that send the current position in the node every time a respawn was attempted. Unfortunately, the script ended up being a bit long and messy with several similar functions. It also produced some unsolvable nonfatal debugger errors that I did not have time to work through. In the end, my solution works and makes the game more dynamic-looking. On the other hand, I had a lot of fun designing the art for this project!
